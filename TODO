TODOs
=====

- [x] Fix: Command `ssht` is broken, since entry-point is changed

- [ ] Feature: (TUI) Implement view graph
- [ ] Feature: (TUI) Implement create/delete group/host mechanism
- [ ] Feature: (TUI) Implement reordering of groups/hosts
- [ ] Feature: (SSHC) Implement mechanism to clean ssh-fingerprints for host/group
- [ ] Feature: (SSHC) Implement that HOST TEST uses paramiko to perform native SSH testing, not relying on SSH command
  - Paramiko offers great UN/PW auth, but lacks openssh native features, such as jumphosts
  - Testing via jumphosts might not be possible, but require more developement on top of paramiko
  - Some libs, such as "fabric" implement some of the features, including some "ssh config" parsing, but limited
  - Only way to really provide full scope of testing via paramiko, is to implement our own support for manually building jumphost chains of connections, and applying each SSH Config options.
- [ ] Feature: (SSHC) Implement HOST TEST to verify and print graph of linked connection trace-ing, and passed test
