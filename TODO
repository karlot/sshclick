TODOs:
- [x] Fix: Command `ssht` is broken, since entry-point is changed
- [x] Fix: Linked assets are not displayed properly on PyPI Readme, provide full links to github page
- [ ] Implement that HOST TEST uses paramiko to perform native SSH testing, not relying on SSH command
  - Might be problematic... paramiko offers great UN/PW auth, but lacks some SSH native features, such as jumphosts
  - Testing of hosts via jumphosts might not be possible, or might require much more extensive developement on top of paramiko
  - Some libs, such as "fabric" implement some of the features, including some "ssh config" parsing, but limited
  - Only way to really provide full scope of testing via paramiko, is to implement our own support for manually building jumphost chains of connections, and applying each SSH Config options.
- [ ] Implement HOST TEST to verify and print graph of linked connection trace-ing, and passed test for all connected hosts
- [ ] Implement feature to clean ssh-fingerprints for host/group
- [ ] TUI - Implement view graph
- [ ] TUI - Implement create/delete group/host mechanism
- [ ] TUI - Implement reordering of groups/hosts
- [ ] Low: Rename `tapes` to `assets` and relink all stuff from README
- [ ] Low: VHS Tape for generating GIF file for TUI mode is breaking the layout... ?!
